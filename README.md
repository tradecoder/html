## HTML Tutorial

HTML is Hypertext Markup Language. It is used to build websites. Anyone who wants to learn to build websites, learning HTML is a must. 
A single HTML web page has mainly some essential parts- `html, head, body`. Here is a basic formation of HTML pages
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>

  <head>
    <title>Page Title</title>
  </head>
  
  <body>
    Web contents will go here
  </body>
</html>
```
Here `<!Doctype html>` indicates that it's HTML5 version. 


HTML codes are wrapped inside `<html> and </html>` tag. <br/>
HTML contents are wrapped in other html tags. Every tag has an opening and a closing tag except only a few of them, at the same time this type of tag has self closing tag. <br/>
`<>` this is an opening tag mark and `</>` this is a closing tag mark. <br/>
So if we want to use the html tag in our page we need to use it in such way <br/>
```
<html>

<!-- here above is with the opening tag -->
<!-- and below is with the closing -->

</html>
```
